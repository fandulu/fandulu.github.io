- *2023.10*: ðŸŽ‰ Our Gymnastic Judging Support System has been successfully applied in 10 apparatuses at [the 52nd FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Championships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CinAYBZYANg). I was responsible for developing the multi-camera gymnast detection and tracking modules for our system. Parts of the related techniques have been published in my [WACV2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14317.pdf) and [CVM2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03820.pdf) papers, with more details to come in my journals currently under review.
